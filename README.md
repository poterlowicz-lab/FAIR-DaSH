## FAIR on Demand

This short online course caters to anyone working with biological data and provides the necessary know-how to make data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).  
The course walks the trainees through all FAIR principles, with examples to understand the basics of data management and how to implement the principles with real-life scenarios. Trainees will familiarise themselves and learn how to use resources to make their data FAIR, such as RDMkit, FAIRCookbook, FAIRsharing or Data Stewardship Wizard. These are ELIXIR-endorsed resources committed to sustainability and open access. The course also highlights references for further information to larges pieces of training and reading.
